# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains my implementation of various Data Structures and Algorithms using Java programming language. 
The code is organized in a way that the implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms are grouped together.

The repository contains the following topics:

* Recursion & Backtracking
* Linear Data Structures
* Non-linear Data Structures
* Sorting Algorithms
* Searching Algorithms

I have tried to write clean and readable code along with proper comments to help understand each implementation.

Feel free to use the code as per the terms of the MIT license

Please give a ðŸŒŸ if you find the code helpful.

If anyone wants to add to this, they are most welcome to do so, I will be happy to review and merge the changes.
